<p align="center">
“SpaceDog”, inspired by the classic “Spaceman” game. The mechanics will remain the same as the inspired game but spacedog will introduce a theme revolving around aliens and a dog. 
In Spacedog, players must prevent a dog from being abducted by aliens. The objective is to correctly guess the word by selecting letters. Each incorrect guess brings the dog closer to abduction
</p>

## 🛸 GAME MECHANICS 
- Player is given a word initialized by blanks, the goal is to complete the word by selecting a 
letter from the keyboard 
- Player is given 5 chances to complete the word
- Each incorrect letter will decrease the number of chances

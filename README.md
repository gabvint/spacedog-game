## SPACEDOG
“SpaceDog”, inspired by the classic “Spaceman” game. The mechanics will remain the same as the inspired game but spacedog will introduce a theme revolving around aliens and a dog. 
In Spacedog, players must prevent a dog from being abducted by aliens. The objective is to correctly guess the word by selecting letters. Each incorrect guess brings the dog closer to abduction
